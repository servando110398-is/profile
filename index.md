## Welcome to my Portfolio Website 
Here you will find projects on Data Cleaning, EDA and Web Scraping.

# Data Cleaning
![This is an image](https://wallpaper.dog/large/20476860.jpg)
Messy data is always a problem in  the analysis process. Most analyst spend their time dealing with  problems in their data such as duplicates, null values, wrong formatting , you name it. Sometimes it feels like one has to jump through a lot of hoops in order to get the dataset in the correct fromat. In this project I cleaned a movies dataset with R. You can compare the results by looking at both the initial csv file and the clean one.

# Web Scraping

The very first step in the analytics process is coming up with a research question, then it comes data collection. In this small project I use  Python's 
Beautifulsoup library to scrape data from 'La Liga' soccer league website. Jupyter notebooks let's us go through the code nicely, step by step.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

:dollar:  :bulb:
Forbes posts a list containing the names of  billionaires around the world every year.The dataset used in this project contains names, ages, net worth,
industry,rank and country of every billionaire on that list for the year of 2021.
Which countries have the most billionaires? What's the average age of a billionaire ? These are some of the questions that I tried to answer in this project. With nice ggplot visualisations we will see how that data looks like.
