#Data Cleaning
![This is an image](https://wallpaper.dog/large/20476860.jpg)
Messy data is always a problem in  the analysis process. Most analyst spend their time dealing with  problems in their data such as duplicates, null values, wrong formatting , you name it. Sometimes it feels like one has to jump through a lot of hoops in order to get the dataset in the correct fromat. In this project I cleaned a movies dataset with R. You can compare the results by looking at both the initial csv file and the clean one.
